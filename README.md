# Navigating through Research Software Engineering as an undergraduate

[![Talk](https://img.shields.io/badge/RSE_Careers_Panel_ETHZ_25-talk-blue?logo=github&logoColor=white&color=blue)](./slides.pdf)

Introductory talk for RSE Career Talks and Panel at ETH Zurich.

Research Software Engineering is primarily dominated by employees who hold a PhD, but this narrative is slowly changing, as even though a PhD teaches one essential research skills, programming skills can be learned without any formal education. Being a Research Software Engineer with just an undergraduate degree, I will be sharing the challenges I faced while navigating this relatively new field and how the experience has shaped my view of Research Software Engineering. Moreover, I will share my experience of working at UK's largest RSE group and how the Swiss RSE movement can take positive inspirations from our ways of working. Finally, I will be joining graduate school after working as an RSE for more than a year, which raises the question and the theme for my talk - should graduate-level education be an essential criteria for hiring an RSE?
